## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the use of flexbox for positioning items on a webpage and how to import and use external fonts in web design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla:ital,wght@0,200..800;1,200..800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex: 1;
}



### Continued development

Flexbox
Media Query
Basic CSS properties


### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me on how to structure a webpage using semantic and non-semantic tags, creating easy access to html elements during the styling process
